# How to Use Tootie Reminders
This guide will help you set up and use Tootie Reminders, the cheeky WhatsApp bot that's all set to help you keep your loved one in high spirits!

## Setup
### Install Dependencies
```
npm install
```

## Setup Environment Variables:
We use environment variables to securely store sensitive information. You'll find a file in the root directory named `.env_template`. Make a copy of this file and name it `.env`.
```
cp .env_template .env
```
Open up the newly created `.env` file and you'll see something like this:
```
OPENAI_KEY=
PHONE_NUMBER=
```
Fill in the `OPENAI_KEY` with your OpenAI key and `PHONE_NUMBER` with the recipient's phone number. Make sure to keep this file safe and do not commit it or share it.

### Set Up Your OpenAI API Key
In order to generate personalized messages, you need to use OpenAI's GPT-3. For this, you will need an API key from OpenAI. Visit their website to sign up and get your key.

Once you have your key, replace 'your_openai_api_key' in the index.js file with your actual OpenAI API key.

### Set Up Recipient's Number
Replace `1234567890@c.us` with the recipient's number (include country code without the + sign) in the following format: `<country-code-without-+><number>@c.us`. For example, for a US number (123) 456-7890, you would enter `11234567890@c.us`.

### Run the Script
```
node index.js
```
You'll see a QR code pop up in your terminal. Scan this code with the WhatsApp account you want to send the messages from, and voilÃ ! Your reminders are set.

### Customization
You can customize the times and content of your reminders. This project uses the `node-cron` library to schedule tasks, and cron strings to define the schedule.

In the `reminders` array, each object has a `cron` property (the schedule) and a `prompt` property (the message prompt that's sent to OpenAI GPT-3 to generate the message).

If you want to change the schedule or the content of the reminders, you can simply edit the cron strings or the prompts in this array.

That's it! You're all set to add a little more joy to your loved one's day with Tootie Reminders.
